fixed in v0.15:
v242434 - this is not set; need to investigate the ramifications of enabling protectKernelDefaults
v242436 - this is not explicitly set but is enabled by default in current versions of Kubernetes
v242462 - our audit-log-maxsize is 50; requirement is 100; should be simple to fix
v242462 - our audit-log-maxbackup is 3; requirement is 10; should be simple to fix
v242541 - we have streaming connection idle timeout disabled (0s); it should be set to 5m
v242465 - we are using stdout for audit log; STIG requires this to be a real file for audit trails
v242437 - PSP has been removed in v0.15

maybe:

v242397 - we are using kubelet's staticPodPath, so we cannot disable it: CAT I
v242403 - we use Metadata audit logging instead of RequestResponse audit logging; could change, but need to evaluate trade-offs: CAT II
v242404 - we do set `hostname-override`, but this is handled internally and automatically, integrated with the TLS configuration, so this addresses the intention of the STIG, if not the letter of the check: CAT II
v242418 - we do not use the approved cipher list; we contain a number of newer ones, but no weaker or older ones: CAT II
v242438 - by strict reading, this is a finding, but it appears the _intention_ is as we have it : CAT II


unclear:
v242410 - says we must be compliant with PPSM CAL, but it doesn't describe what and how.  There referenced doc 8551.01 isn't any better.
v242411 - says we must be compliant with PPSM CAL, but it doesn't describe what and how.  There referenced doc 8551.01 isn't any better.
v242412 - says we must be compliant with PPSM CAL, but it doesn't describe what and how.  There referenced doc 8551.01 isn't any better.
v242413 - says we must be compliant with PPSM CAL, but it doesn't describe what and how.  There referenced doc 8551.01 isn't any better.
